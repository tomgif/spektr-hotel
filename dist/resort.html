            <h2>Climate in Bodrum</h2>
            <div class="b-slide__text"> 
              <p>The climate in Bodrum compared to other regions of Turkey, is moderate and pleasant. This is due to the influence of the Aegean Sea, which is particularly cooler than the Mediterranean Sea, therefore keeping a lower humidity level. Water temperature remains high for a much longer period than other similar coastal areas of Turkey. In October, you can experience the so called "velvet season" which has now become a great opportunity for holidays thanks to a perfect combination of the water and air temperature. In addition, there are fewer tourists and the prices for accommodation and airfare are decreasing from the very hot and busy high season in the summer.</p>
              <p>In general, Bodrum has over 330 sunny days a year, making the wintertime tolerable. The coldest months would be January and February with temperatures dropping to 5°C at night. However, the average day temperature is about 13°C. This period is also considered the rainy season with somewhat frequent storms and a strong wind from the north. Even though the storms are common in the winter months, they are usually short, lasting no longer than a day or two.</p>
              <p>Another particularity of Bodrum is lack of transition from winter to summer period. The locals have a saying "half of March - Winter, half of March - Summer". March and April are also defined by an extreme difference between day and night temperatures. During the day, you can sunbathe, however in the evening you will be caught up in the famous Mediterranean wind Lodos or Poyraz. Therefore, it’s best to stay inside in a cozy café with a fireplace for a cup of tea or coffee.</p>
              <p>The summer season is defined as moderate in June and hot in July and August with temperatures rising up to and average of 32°C and the sea reaching solid 25°C. Again, due to low humidity high temperatures are easily tolerated even during those rare hot days when the temperature reaches 40°C. This climate is favorable for people with diseases of the respiratory tract and recommended by doctors worldwide.  All in all, the majority of sunny days a year, fresh air and healthy sea climate attracts more and more visitors for all year round stays.</p>
              <p>The best time to be in Bodrum weather wise is September, when the water temperature increases to its limit and the air temperature decreases to a pleasant 26°C. This is the perfect time for a healthy suntan due to reduced UV light intensity. It is also a great opportunity to explore all the attractions of Bodrum and the surrounding areas with a group, or as an individual without endless queues and massive crowds.</p>
              <p>Thanks to the pleasant weather in the fall, the touristic season is prolonged as far as November. People appreciate the diversity of Bodrum and make use of indoor and outdoor activities besides swimming and beaches. More and more tourists are coming for Christmas holidays to get away from cold and wet or snowy weather in their home countries and experience a different New Years’ under the palm trees and the sun.</p>
              <p>Bodrum was already well-known as the ultimate holiday destination even during the antique period. Aegean coast was praised as homeland of the Gods in ancient mythology. Herodotus, a famous historian of that time, said that Bodrum "is the most beautiful heaven on earth and has the best climate” when he visited Halicarnassus. Poet Homer sang of the Aegean Sea as a "paradise of eternal blue."</p>
              <p>Interesting fact about Bodrum, when it comes to weather forecasting, locals will check for the wind. The most common ones are Poyraz, Lodos and Meltem. Poyraz is a cold and strong northeastern wind, known especially for it’s violent temper causing damage in the streets. Lodos is a warm southwest wind from the Aegean Sea region, coming to the peninsula between December and April, bringing dust from the Sahara Desert. Meltem is the most favorable warm wind and a regular guest at the Aegean coast from mid-May to October. This is the most advantageous wind for sea travel and therefore very beloved amongst yachtsmen and sailors.</p>

              <p>Akyarlar is located 15 km from Bodrum center. Famous for fine sandy beaches, picturesque islands in the vicinity, rough vegetation, warm sea and a relatively small number of tourists, it is ideal for nature lovers who seek complete relaxation. </p>
              <p>Next bay is Turgutreis, which is an ideal place for windsurfing thanks to constant winds. It is also the closest point to the Greek island Kos, offering daily ferry trips from the well-known harbor D-Marin. </p>
              <p>In the northwestern part of the peninsula lies Yalikavak bay. It is very famous for its variety of fancy beach clubs offering entertainment for guests of all ages.</p>
